Ethan: The air is crisp and cool. Pumpkins have been appearing throughout the last few nights
Some with spooky faces
Narrator: A scent wafts through the air. A fishy scent. A tasty smell.
Narrator: *Stomach Rumbles*
Narrator: Following the smell, you stumble across two cats pawing at a fishbone
[???]Frank the Cat: You know I found this first, so back off!
[???]Josie: Get away you old man, this is my meal now. 
[???]Frank the Cat: If you have any sense, leave now and you can keep whatever mangey lives you have left. 
[???]Josie: Old man… Wait, someone's coming.
[???]Josie: Who’s there?
PC: [1] Hello, my name’s {Name}. I couldn’t help but smell that tasty fish and was hoping you would share a nibble. [2] I don’t owe you my name, but if you give me a taste, we can chat.

[???]Frank the Cat: What a polite cat! Josie, you could learn a lot from that youngling.

[???]Frank the Cat: What a scheming cat, would you not talk to us without trying to profit?
[Resume]
[Mad]Josie: Ugh, Frank. You're one to talk
[Happy]Frank the Cat: I am! Anyways little one, ignore her, she's just hungry.
Where are you from?
